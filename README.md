# AdvancedAlzheimersModel
Many third world countries lack the appropriate skill and medical technology to make advanced diagnoses in a speedy fashion. This model, when completed, will increase access to medical technology to those who can not afford it, saving lives lost due to late diagnoses of Alzheimer's (when it progresses to Dimentia).


## Editors Note

This project is current a work in progress, expected to be completed within the next month. It is my attempt at improving upon my previous Alzheimer's agent. Wheras my previous agent relied soley on MRI images of the brain (98.44% accuracy), obtaining an MRI is not an easy process for many. This model aims to take demographics and lifestyle into account as well. 

I am a recent Computer Science graduate with a focus in AI/ML, along with industry experience in QA & DevOps automation. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this program, please reach out!
